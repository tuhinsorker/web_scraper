A web scraper is a software tool used to extract data from websites. It automates the process of gathering information from web pages by simulating human browsing behavior, accessing the HTML code of web pages, and extracting relevant data based on predefined rules or patterns. This extracted data can then be saved, analyzed, or used for various purposes such as market research, price comparison, or content aggregation. Web scrapers can be custom-built or obtained through third-party services, and they are commonly used in fields like e-commerce, finance, research, and data analysis.
